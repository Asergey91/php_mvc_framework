-Model/View/Controller (MVC) architecture
Kinda got carried away with this one, ended up writing a simple mvc framework from scratch. Tried to make it similar in workflow to RoR.

-Simplicity & readability
Well as for my controller, model and view they should be pretty straight forward

-Scalability
In terms of development this should be pretty scalable, in terms of performance caching needs to be implemented

-Performance
Like mentioned above, I didn't have the time to implement caching. As for algorithms i tried to keep them as linear in complexity as I could

-Normalisation in data storage
Ids and timestamps are automatically created in my framework, schemas are easy to edit with the schema class

-Security
Inputs are escaped for SQL, and validated with respect/validator

-How long the solution took to implement?
3 days for the framework, about 4 hours for the actual tech test

-Things Id implement if I had more time
    propper routing
    better error handling
    much more and better helper methods
    caching
    made thing pretty
